          This is LVM2, the rewrite of The Linux Logical Volume Manager.
          LVM supports enterprise level volume management of disk and disk
          subsystems by grouping arbitrary disks into volume groups. The total
          capacity of volume groups can be allocated to logical volumes, which
          are accessed as regular block devices.
          The Linux Kernel Device Mapper is the LVM
          (Linux Logical Volume Management) Team's implementation of a
          minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles volume management,
          while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout in
          user-space. This makes it useful for not only LVM, but EVMS,
          software raid, and other drivers that create "virtual" block devices.
